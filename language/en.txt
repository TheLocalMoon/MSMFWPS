lockrock=Lockrock_test
lockrock_bio=The starter of all Key elementals. Evolving from having eyes on their mouths, one thing you may not know about this monster is that it has perfect hygiene! You may think how without any arms, but with the help with a bopells floating hand it can have the best teeth cleaning in the entire island!

lockrock_rare=Rare Lockrock
lockrock_rare_bio=A company once tried to turn all monsters on Key Island into robots... only one succeeded, and you have... Rare Lockrock... They were going to have 2 arms and 2 legs but the original Lockrock attacked the company-

bopell=Bopell
bopell_bio=Welcome to the monster choir, where all the best monsters are here to sing..... wait... why is bopell here? Do you even know them anyways? Formed when a stone is shaved eyeholes, another stone is shaped to form a hand, and with a bit of magic we get bopell!

bopell_rare=Rare Bopell
bopell_rare_bio=Rare Bopells are often very caring for their babies, but not when playing! Instead of a bell, they knock their nests with their children inside, luckily their children don't mind.

triturtoud=Triturtoud
triturtoud_bio=In this universe, instead of blarrets, we have Triturtouds. Sounding almost the same, you'd wonder if they know each other, and the answer is yes! Through some advanced tech in the monster world, they have been able to communicate, wow!

triturtoud_rare=Rare Triturtoud
triturtoud_rare_bio=Unlike the common triturtoud, which is all soft and friendly, the rare is the complete opposite! Instead of clouds, there are thunderclouds, the result of construction not being finished whilst triturtoud was walking through the island with it's eyes closed, and falling OFF the island! It took 7 hours for the monsters to bring rare triturtoud back.

glockenbopp=Glockenbopp
glockenbopp_bio=This monster is a close relative to the bopell on Key Island, only difference is that.... why am I even saying this? It is the complete opposite!

stomper=Stomper
stomper_bio=The starter of Cartoon Island, how did they get here? Only the monster gods know. Anyways, this is a weird monster, not getting up to eat or anything, he just... sits there..

stomper_rare=Rare Stomper
stomper_rare_bio=Unlike the common stomper, rare stompers are environmentalists. They don't jump up and down, it kills the grass! Instead, they opt to use drums.

string_unfinishedIsland=This island is unfinished! Some monsters may not sing or have bad/broken animations!
